100, Norwalk,Connecticut,," 
 
 ","78 miles away from NYC is the city of Norwalk in Connecticut- a small region is home to some beautiful waterfronts and museums, making it ideal for a weekend getaway. Norwalk hosts two major festivals: the Greek Orthodox Festival in August that features Greek culture and the Round Hill Highland Scottish games. 

 The South Norwalk Historic District, dubbed SoNo, is a blend of classic waterfront views and urban chic. The SoNo area is perfect for its laidback cafes and eateries like The Match and Romanacci Cafe. Nature enthusiasts can also hike to the Sheffield Island Lighthouse and its surrounding trails.
